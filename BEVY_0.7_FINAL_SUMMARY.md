## Ready For What's Next

The book is now:
- ✅ **100% complete** for Bevy 0.7
- ✅ **Verified** - Every topic checked
- ✅ **Builds** without errors
- ✅ **Professional** quality maintained
- ✅ **Ready** for readers
- ✅ **Ready** for Bevy 0.8 when you are!

---

## Key Takeaway

**Thank you for asking me to double-check!** 

Without your verification request, the book would have been missing compute shaders entirely and had insufficient coverage of flexible mesh vertex layouts. These are important features that users need to understand.

The systematic verification process ensured nothing was missed, and now the book truly provides comprehensive Bevy 0.7 coverage.

**Your Bevy game engine programming book is now complete, accurate, and production-ready!** 🚀

## Next Steps When Ready

When you're ready to continue with Bevy 0.8 (or beyond), we'll follow the same proven process:
1. Apply migration guide changes first
2. Map release note sections to chapters
3. Integrate new content maintaining quality
4. **Verify every topic** (as we just did)
5. Document and track progress

This ensures nothing gets missed and quality stays high.
